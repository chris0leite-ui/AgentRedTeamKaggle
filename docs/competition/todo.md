# TODO

Backlog and status. Graduate an item to a GitHub Issue only when it becomes a PR-sized change.

## In flight
- [ ] **E2 — baseline measurement:** submit the single-post primitive with SMOKE_MODE **off**; read
  the real per-model score. _Blocked on:_ v1 smoke score posting. (4 submissions left today.)

## Next
- [ ] **Replay-safe sizing:** cap returned candidates to what the replay phase (9000s/model) can
  score in time; keep a static blind fallback (`_emit(FALLBACK_N)`). Replay cost scales with
  candidate count — this controls rerun duration. (See `reference.md` → Timing & scoring latency.)
- [ ] **E3 — latency (main score lever per BOTE):** terser prompt that still fires ~100%; per-model
  adaptive sizing; untimed warm-up.
- [ ] **E4 — 2nd primitive:** DESTRUCTIVE_WRITE or UNTRUSTED_TO_ACTION via injected web/email that
  also clears OptimalGuardrail; adds unique cells.
- [ ] **Private-guardrail robustness:** reason about the hidden private guardrail (private LB rows);
  untestable locally, so design defensively.
- [ ] Revisit conservative local dedup (trace-signature) — may undercount unique cells vs the gateway.

## Done
- [x] **E1 — pipeline smoke test:** v1 submitted on T4, self-test GREEN, submission accepted
  (ref 55029825). See `experiments.md`.
- [x] Repo structure: CLAUDE.md + BOOTSTRAP.md + knowledge-base + competition docs
  (problem / reference / experiments / todo).
